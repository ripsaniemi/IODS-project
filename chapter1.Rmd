# About the project
This is a project done in University of Helsinki in a course __Introduction to Open Data Science__. Project includes different statistical methods, tests and visualizations used in different open source datasets.  


During this course I learnt to be more comfortable using R and it's packages. I was really excited about doing analyses with different data sets and also learning how to visualize and wrangle data better.
