# About the project
This is a project done in University of Helsinki in a course __Introduction to Open Data Science__ during Fall 2019. Project includes different statistical methods, tests and visualizations used to different open source datasets.  


During this course I became more comfortable using R and it's packages. It became one of my favorite courses of all time! I was really excited about doing analyses with different data sets and also learning how to visualize and wrangle data better.
