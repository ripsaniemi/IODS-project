# About the project

During this course I'd like to become more comfortable using R and it's packages. I've done a few courses with R already, but I still hava a lot to learn. I am excited to do analyses with different data sets and also learn to __visualize__ and to edit data. My friend did this course last year and she recommended it to me.
