# Week 3: Logistic regression

## 1)

## 2) Reading the datasets

```{r} 

alc <- read.csv("data/alc.csv")

glimpse(alc)


```
This dataset has 35 variables and 382 observations. It was collected from two Portuguese secondary education schools and has variables about socio-economical background, studying and free time.

## 3) Relationships with high/low alcohol use

I am choosing my variables as goout, studytime, famrel and higher.

My personal hypothesis is that goout affects high_use positively and studytime, higher education, and quality family relationships affect high_use negatively.


## 4) Numerical & graphical exploration of the variable distributions and relationship with high_use
